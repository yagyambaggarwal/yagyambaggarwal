- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yagyam_b_aggarwal
- 👀 im highly conscious about world in terms of technology as it is eventually leading the world. even the third world countries(one of which I proudly belong) now are engaged an engrossed in tech "directly". thus i feel its too important to make the internet much more interactive and a space that has the solution of each and every human problem.
- Also, i see it as my great credential that i cleared NEET UG(2023) but left because of the craze and real passion for the new upcoming soft-world. 
- 🌱 I know basics of c, cpp, java and currently learning DSA(in java) to enhance my problem solving ability to make the tech-world strong and reliable.
-  Also learning web development.
- I want to learn to make games for VR and UR. its been a while since we got any positive serious upcurve in terms of our tech, these technologies i believe are the game changing future and are actually going to revolutionize the market and the world. thus to make content for these technologies and get into the new upcoming ecosystem.
- 💞️ open to job opportunities or collaborations.
- im commited to begin learning new skill in every 45 to 60 days. 
- 📫 please contact me at vishuaggarwal219@gmail.com
